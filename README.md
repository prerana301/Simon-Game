# Simon Game
## freeCodeCamp Advanced Front End Development Project
## [Live Demo](https://jimmy-guzman.github.io/simongame/)
### Project Goals Completed:
* The user is presented with a random series of button presses.
* Each time the user inputs a series of button presses correctly, they see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.
* The user hears a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when they personally press a button.
* If the user presses the wrong button, they are notified that they have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so they can try again.
* The user can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.
* If the user wants to restart, they can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.
* The user can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies them that they have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.
* The user can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. they are notified of my victory, then the game starts over.
## Future Updates:
* Layout redesign
* Let the user know if strict mode is active
* Update sounds
